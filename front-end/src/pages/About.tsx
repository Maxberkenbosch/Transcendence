                    It's been six hours. Dreams move one... one-hundredth the
                    speed of reality, and dog time is one-seventh human time. So
                    y'know, every day here is like a minute. It's like
                    Inception, Morty, so if it's confusing and stupid, then so
                    is everyone's favorite movie. I can finally go on that trip
                    I've been talking about. Then let me GET to know you! I'm
                    Scary Terry!! You can run but you can't hide, bitch!

                    Well, if it's God power that gets you going, light some
                    candles and put on the Billy Ocean, 'cause Moses is home,
                    and he's ready to burn some bush! I turned myself into a
                    pickle, Morty! Boom! Big reveal! I'm a pickle! What do you
                    think about that? I turned myself into a pickle! W-what are
                    you just staring at me for, bro? I turned myself into a
                    pickle, Morty. The algorithm learns your preferences better
                    that way. Plus, if you get in kind of a cool enough
                    relationship, you can sort of follow each other and check
                    out each other's kinks, you know? I'm sorry Summer, your
                    opinion means very little to me.

                    Yeah, those two were fucking. If you break the rules, try to
                    leave or lose the game, you will die. Just like Saaaaw.

                    Why is "lesbian" part of her job title? I don't like it here
                    Morty. I can't abide bureaucracy. I don't like being told
                    where to go and what to do. I consider it a violation. Did
                    you get those seeds all the way up your butt? Well, to be
                    honest, I'm kind of grossed out with the sexual nature of
                    how everything unfolded. I didn't know how sexual dragons
                    were. I kind of just wanted to do some D&D stuff, y'know?
                    Don't be trippin dog we got you.

                    You're missing the point Morty. Why would he drive a smaller
                    toaster with wheels? I mean, does your car look like a
                    smaller version of your house? No. Nice to wheat you! Nice
                    one, Ms Pancakes. Honey, stop raising your father's
                    colesterol so you can take a hot funeral selfie.

                    Alan Rails, ladies and gentlemen. After his parents' tragic
                    death in a railroad accident, he gained the power to summon
                    ghost trains. It's not all bad though, they were spared
                    having to see their grown son wear a whistle. You're young,
                    you have your whole life ahead of you, and your anal cavity
                    is still taut yet malleable. Morty, I'm a drunk, not a hack.
                    25 shmeckles? I-I-I-I don't even know what that- what is

                    This aftershave made women want me, but it also made me
                    impotent! Puffy vagina. Man, that guy is the Red Grin
                    Grumbold of pretending he knows what's going on. Oh you
                    agree huh? You like that Red Grin Grumbold reference? Well
                    guess what, I made him up. You really are your father's
                    children. Think for yourselves, don't be sheep. If anything

                    Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you but what people
                    call "love" is just a chemical reaction that compels animals
                    to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving
                    you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it. Your parents
                    are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above. Focus
                    on science. I'll tell you how I feel about school, Jerry.
                    It's a waste of time. Bunch of people runnin' around bumpin'
                    into each other, got a guy up front says, '2 + 2,' and the
                    people in the back say, '4.' Then the bell rings and they
                    give you a carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you
                    can go take a dump or somethin'. I mean, it's not a place
                    for smart people, Jerry. I know that's not a popular
                    opinion, but that's my two cents on the issue. And that's
                    why I always say 'Shumshumschilpiddydah!' Nothing to read
                    into there!
